# NumberGuessingGame
My first Java project: A number guessing game 

A beginner-friendly Java console application where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number. This is my first project as I start learning Java and programming!

ðŸ”§ Features
*Random number generation
*Input from the user using Scanner
*Feedback after each guess (Too high, Too low, Correct)
*Looping until the correct guess is made
